Forced to be a coder
I'm 54 years old, and basically, I'm just starting to learn programming. I've been working in a data center for 17 years, mostly dealing with hardware and infrastructure. Now, hardware doesn't matter - software and automation rule the world, and if I do not jump on board, well, a barista career would not be that bad!
